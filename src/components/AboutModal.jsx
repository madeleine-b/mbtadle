        <p><strong>Multiple routings may be possible</strong> to make the trip, but your goal is to
        find <strong>the one routing</strong> that matches the puzzle of the day. The solution <strong>may or may not</strong> be the fastest or efficient routing. It should also be noted that in the New York City Subway system, there are <strong>multiple stations with the same name</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>No back tracking:</strong> No stations can be traveled through more than once.</p>
        <p><strong>Transfers are only allowed if and when lines diverge</strong> (i.e. if two lines are making the same stops, you can't switch back and forth between them,
          You can switch from a local line to an express line then back to the same local line, but you can't switch from an express line to a local line back to the same express line).</p>
        <p><strong>Transfers are allowed to/from St George station</strong> via <strong>South Ferry</strong>, <strong>Whitehall Stâ€“South Ferry</strong> or <strong>Bowling Green stations</strong> (using the Staten Island Ferry). Transfers are also allowed between stations with <strong>free out-of-system transfers</strong>.
          It is assumed that all stations allow transfer in all directions, even when they're not physically possible in real life (limitation due to this data is not being publicly available).</p>
        <p>Routing for each train line is based on <strong>midday schedule</strong> (i.e. no peak-direction express, no peak-only branches, no 
          Z, B terminates at 145 St). <strong>Weekend puzzles are based on regularly-scheduled weekend routings.</strong></p>
